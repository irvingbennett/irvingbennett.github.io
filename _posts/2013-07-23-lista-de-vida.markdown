Desde hace tiempo he mantenido una especie de "Bucket List", mi lista de vida, usando fuentes de inspiración como la revista Outside que publica [listas](http://www.outsideonline.com/adventure-travel/north-america/The-2013-Adventure-Bucket-List.html) de manera regular. La Película ["Antes de Morir"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bucket_List) le dió un nombre claro a estas listas: cosas que quiero hacer antes de morir. En [43 Things](http://www.43things.com/person/irving) se pueden hacer estas listas y darle seguimiento de cuando en vez para ver como vamos progresando en nuestro plan de vida general. Ultimamente el punto que estuvo una vez en la lista, tener hijos, que seguía al punto conseguir esposa, ha comenzado a prevalecer sobre todos los otros puntos en la lista.

Hay algunos objetivos a los que no se les puede poner el gancho inmediatamente y que llevan toda una vida completándose. Por eso también es importante tener pequeños objetivos que puedan llenar los espacios intermedios entre los puntos grandes y las metas a largo plazo. Ahora mismo una de mis metas a medio plazo es Rocky Raccoon y hacer esas 100 millas en menos de 24 horas (febrero 2014). Pero en ese camino necesito tener otras pequeñas metas personales, familiares y financieras.

## I've written 45 entries



Goal: Climb aconcagua
Title: March 2005
Date: 2006-04-26T20:10:52Z
Body: Together with my broter Rogelio we went to climb Aconcagua on February 2005. We got all the way up to Refugio Berlin and then were trapped for three days in a storm. After that we ran out of time and energies to finish the climb on that trip. It is still on my list, though. http://alairelibre.ws/gallery/v/aconcagua http://alairelibre.net/aconcagua/ViajeAconcagua.htm

Goal: Visit italy
Title: Cinqueterre and the Amalfi Coast, Florence and Venice
Date: 2006-04-26T20:41:05Z
Body: Great country! La Toscana has a well deserved reputation. The Amalfi Coast is a great drive with some towns perched in impossible places. Florence is my favorite city in the whole world: it has the "Birth of Venus", "il David", and great ice cream - all within walking distance of each other.

Goal: Visit france
Title: Paris, Marseille, Aix-en-Provence
Date: 2006-04-27T01:57:23Z
Body: It lives up to all expectations. Aix is wonderful, best in spring when the flowers are in bloom.

Goal: Eat caviar
Title: Highly over rated
Date: 2006-04-27T02:06:31Z
Body: I like it very much, but I still think it is an acquired taste that is rated higher than it deserves.

Goal: Run a marathon
Title: Panama Marathon
Date: 2006-04-27T02:08:20Z
Body: It is one of the toughest in the world. It is very hot down here! When you are in the final stretch and the sun is baking you, every last bit of resolve is neeeded.

Goal: Own a dog
Title: We have 3 dobermans
Date: 2006-04-27T02:16:05Z
Body: Dog are a bundle of love!

Goal: Speak spanish fluently
Title: Native tongue
Date: 2006-04-27T02:59:04Z
Body: It comes naturally...

Goal: Shoot a bow and arrow
Title: A great sport
Date: 2006-04-27T16:53:12Z
Body: It is worth doing, and doing well.

Goal: Eat an iguana...thats weird
Title: Iguanas are tasty
Date: 2006-04-28T01:13:46Z
Body: This is not very weird if you live in the tropics. We call iguanas "gallinas de palo" (tree chickens). They even taste like chicken. At a diner, long time ago, my grandmother fed iguana stew to some Spanish priests. Afterwards, one of them commented on how delicious the chicken had been. My grandmother answered: that was not chicken, it was iguana! They all got up and puked!

Goal: Ski spiral stairs
Title: Spiral Stairs, Telluride
Date: 2006-04-28T02:30:35Z
Body: I am probably getting too old for this goal. It is a double black diamond run down the face of Telluride that goes into town. It is like Al's Run in Taos, but steeper and longer.

Goal: Go canoeing
Title: Down the Tabasará
Date: 2006-04-28T02:49:13Z
Body: !http://alairelibre.ws/gallery/d/2749-2/P4230026.jpg! I love canoeing and kayaking. I like canoeing for longer camping runs down easier rivers. It is a great vehicle for the family. Here is our last trip down the "Tabasara.":http://alairelibre.ws/gallery/v/Tabasara/

Goal: Get married
Title: Twice now!
Date: 2006-04-28T02:57:13Z
Body: It is a toss up: hard work most of the time, with short moments of bliss. Kids trebble its worth.

Goal: Build a website
Title: Al Aire Libre
Date: 2006-04-28T03:13:42Z
Body: "Al Aire Libre":http://alairelibre.ws is my blog, built on a computer I assembled, on which Linux is installed. The whole process is a lot of fun (with some hard work in the mix). The Net is terrific!

Goal: Enter a 24 hour race
Title: 24 Hours of Adrenalin
Date: 2006-04-28T03:26:56Z
Body: !http://www.24hoursofadrenalin.com/twenty4/images/home/worldSolo.gif! I would love to give it a go at pedaling for 24 hours around a track. This mountain bike race sounds like a whole bunch of fun. I have been trying to convince some friends to enter as a team to give it a spin an see what it is all about. http://www.24hoursofadrenalin.com

Goal: Get in a fight
Title: Not recommended
Date: 2006-04-28T16:13:26Z
Body: I have had dozens. Bottom line: a bad arrangement is usually better than a good fight. But I still get into fights if necessary. I have enjoyed some of the fights. It is hard to get badly hurt in fights as long as nobody gets any hard objects into it.

Goal: Understand my wife
Title: Women are from Venus, Men are from Mars
Date: 2006-04-28T16:41:14Z
Body: I have bought this book seeking some enlightment. I am reading it now. I will report any insight worth sharing. I guess it comes to basic differences in natural reproductive strategies... :)

Goal: Learn how to use wordpress
Title: Wordpress rocks!
Date: 2006-05-04T13:54:10Z
Body: I have enjoyed Wordpress very much. Is is actually fairly easy to set up, and even easier to use. The best way to start with it would be with http://wordpress.com, where you can open a free account. Later on, once you cath the drift of things, you can move to your own server. But that is a different goal...

Goal: Design and build my own home
Title: Design my own home
Date: 2006-05-04T14:13:27Z
Body: When I was younger, much younger, I had trouble falling asleep. I developed a routine. Every night, as I lie in bed, I started imaginig the house I would own and build. And I would imagine the things I would do in my house. The trick worked so well that I can now go to sleep as soon as I rest my head on the pillow. I am now famous for how easily I can go to sleep. But I still do not have the house of my dreams. So I placed this goal back on my list.

Goal: Have my name on the credits for a movie
Title: Drake's Last Voyage
Date: 2006-05-04T23:41:44Z
Body: I was in Drake's Last Voyage, part of BBC's Timewatch series. It was a documentary about Sir Francis [Drake's last voyage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObmZ38ZINEk). He died in Nombre de Dios, in Panama. His troops were trying to invade Panama, and I know some of the route they took to attempt this feat. I did some consulting, and acting, for the documentary. It was filmed by "Alan Ereira":http://www.google.com/search?q=alan+ereira&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official. He put me in the credits, and when I came on screen, he introduced me as Irving Bennett, Explorer. Another funny thing related to this "thing" if you "Google Irving Bennett":http://www.google.com/search?q=irving+bennett&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official, apart from my Flickr photos, the second line is my name in tv.com where they give me credit for an appearance in Ecochallenge Fiji 2002. Isn't that bizarre?

Goal: Cross the panama canal
Title: Great Trip!
Date: 2006-05-06T19:10:12Z
Body: An excellent way to do this is by entering the "Cayuco Race":http://cayucorace.org, a 3 day paddle race from ocean to ocean across the Panama Canal. The next best way, if you have the time, is to volunteer for a linehandler on a small boat. When sailboats, or motorboats, are crossing the canal, they need four linehandlers. Professinal linehandlers, furnished by the Canal, cost $200 each. So small boats gladly take on volunteer linehandlers to do this work.

Goal: Complete a triathlon
Title: Portobello Triathlon, Panama
Date: 2006-05-08T14:53:41Z
Body: This is a great Xterra triathlon in Panama. "Here":http://alairelibre.ws/gallery/v/portobelo2006/ are the pictures for the last one.

Goal: Get arrested
Title: Got arrested for speeding!
Date: 2006-05-11T17:06:16Z
Body: Yes, I was going really fast... Spent the night in jail and did not get out until they bailed me. Then had to stand trial. The charges were wreckless driving, but got away with speeding only. At 4:00 in the morning un an empty highway it is not wreckless, really. But having guns pointed at me is not very funny. Neither are the handcuffs, and the rough handling. I have managed to stay out of jail since. :)

Goal: Get shot
Title: Ouch!
Date: 2006-05-11T17:10:16Z
Body: That one really did hurt! Got shot with bird shot at close range. It was during riots in the times of Noriega in Panama. I ended in the hospital together with other rioters. The day became known as Black Friday. I have over 88 lead pellets left in me, 22 in my right hand. Not recommended!

Goal: Climb a tree
Title: A tall one
Date: 2006-05-11T20:35:21Z
Body: I want to climb ever larger trees. A while ago I read "The High Frontier":http://www.doctorbugs.com/writing.html, a book about exploring the forest canopy. In it the author wrote about his experiences as scientist climbing trees for research. It is greatly illustrated with beautiful photos high in the tropical canopy. I have used some of the techniques he described to climb trees and it is much fun. I recently looked "treeclimbing":http://www.google.com/search?q=treeclimbing&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official in the Internet and discovered that there is lots of information on the Internet.

Goal: Renew my cpr
Title: CPR 30th Anniversary
Date: 2006-05-11T21:41:09Z
Body: This year will be the 30th anniversary of my first CPR certificate. Damn, I am getting ancient! But this is one of those things that I have always kept sort of current. Fortunately, I have never had a need for it. But I still want to be prepared. I always carry a first aid kit in my car, a complete one. It has been a while since I practiced on a dummy...

Goal: Learn linux
Title: Get Fedora!
Date: 2006-05-12T11:36:41Z
Body: I am still learning "Linux":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux, and probably never will stop. It started with Unix on an "NCR Tower":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCR_Corporation#Computers in 1983. An it still has more to it than I have already learned. The good thing about it is that you do not really need to know it all, just the stuff that matters. The problem is that what matters is a moving target. I recently became a "Fedora Ambassador":http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Ambassadors for "Panama":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/panama. That means that I want to promote the adoption of Linux, Fedora in particular, in my country. I have been doing it for a while. I guess I can be one of those boring geeks that like to talk about technology. When it comes to that, Linux is my favorite subject, right up there with the Internet. An excellent way to give Linux a sping is with a Live CD like "Knoppix":http://knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html. Once you get a Knoppix CD, or DVD, just pop it in the drive and boot it up. It comes complete with everything you need.

Goal: Learn to shoot a gun
Title: Owning one is better...
Date: 2006-05-12T21:07:20Z
Body: !http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/66/Supressed-Usp45.jpg/250px-Supressed-Usp45.jpg! The next thing I want is a "suppresor":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppresor. I have been looking for plans on how to build a suppresor. They are not overly complicated things. A silencer is just a series of baffles within a cylinder. A lathe is about the only thing needed to build one, and that is easy get too. The other hard part, just because I do not want to thread the stock barrel of my glock, is getting a second threaded barrel for the 19. And that is also easy to do over the Internet. There is always the option of purchasing one readymade, like the "evolution":http://www.advanced-armament.com/products/pistols/evolution.asp. But that requires some sort of legal justification, like being a spy, or working for the government. It can also be achieved having a friend that fills the previous characteristics. It would just be more fun to build the silencer from scratch. That also makes it untraceable...

Goal: Bike baja
Title: From San Diego to Cabo San Lucas
Date: 2006-05-13T17:21:50Z
Body: There are about 35 things with Baja in them. I guess it is definitely not a very popular destination in this group. But I like the desert. I studied in New Mexico and grew fond of the desert, like Hayduke in an Ed Abbey novel. Where I come from, Panama, it is all green and lush. Baja is a great desert with few people driving by. It would be a great ride down that desolate waste. With the ocean nearby for frequent swims, it has to be the best of both worlds. And when I get to Cabo San Lucas, I can relax and enjoy some beers next to the crytal clear Pacific.

Goal: Hike through a jungle
Title: I love the jungle!
Date: 2006-05-16T14:55:04Z
Body: I feel at home in the jungle. You can say it is one of my passions. I prefer to call it a rainforest because sometimes jungle also infers to someplace dark and nasty. The rainforest is neither dark, nor nasty. Even though only 2% of sunlight reaches the forest floor in a jungle/rainforest, you can see clearly when you are in it. It is also pretty much devoid of mosquitos and other nasty bugs. It is when you are on the fringe of the forest, on perturbed land, especially if there is and abundance of farm animals, that you find plenty of mosquitos and no-see-ums. When you are deep in the jungle, especially in primary jungle, the ground is wide open and you can easilly walk in any direction you want. Only when you get to a place where a tree has recently fallen do you come to a mess of vegetation that makes passage difficult. But it is often easy enough to go around the tangle of new vegetation looking to fill up the gap in the forest canopy. The jungle is often portrayed as impenetrable because its edges are difficult to get through. Also, secondary rainforest is messy. But that is because it is still in the growing phase and the forest canopy is not completely closed. In primary rainforests, the canopy is really high, upwards of a hundred feet, and you feel like in a cathedral. I go to the jungle to find my religion, and I feel close to God when I am deep in it.

Goal: Carve my own paddle
Title: Carve my own paddle
Date: 2006-05-16T15:18:50Z
Body: I want to carve my own paddle. The commercial ones are good, but the design of our local is much better, more practical. Its design is good for paddling, and doing a little of poling off the bottom. Besides, it also looks beautiful.

Goal: Run in the rain
Title: Best way to run
Date: 2006-05-17T03:17:00Z
Body: I used to give up anything I was doing to go running when it started to pour. Where I live, in Panama, it really rains. What I most enjoyed was running through all the pools where you could really splash water with every step. I do not do it so religiously any more. But I wish I would... Today it rained hard. I was very tempted to give up what I was doing, put on my running shoes, and go for a spin while the rain was very heavy. But I knew the rain would not last long, it is still too early in the rainy season for the really long showers.

Goal: Breed puppies
Title: One of the miracles of this world
Date: 2006-05-17T03:51:02Z
Body: Witnessing birth is something magical. It is gory, but so beautiful at the same time. Just make sure you want it! The pretty part is over soon, and then you have to pick up the shit, and clean up the mess. It does not get much better than that! We love our dogs...

Goal: Spear a fish, prepare and eat it
Title: Spearfishing is a rush!
Date: 2006-05-17T13:26:18Z
Body: There are few things more exciting than feeling the tug at the end of the line after shooting at a big fish. Next comes the struggle to reach the surface while the monster tows you in its flight for its life. Everything comes to a halt when the prey shows up in your field of view. Something ancient, predatorial, takes over.

Goal: Learn to tie knots
Title: The Ashley Book of Knots
Date: 2006-05-18T16:00:20Z
Body: "The Ashley Book of Knots":http://www.realknots.com/links/books.htm is the reference on knots. It has "About 3800 different knots, 7000 drawings" and is very entertaining to browse. It is an old book, from past times when ropes ruled the maritime trades. Now there are some new knots for climbing, caving, and treeclimbing, but all the old favorites are in "TABOK":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ashley_Book_of_Knots.

Goal: Become a morning person.
Title: Already sweating by the crack of dawn
Date: 2006-06-05T14:34:46Z
Body: There are only so many daylight hours, the only way to take advantage of all of them is to be up way before dawn starts brightening the sky.

Goal: Sharpen my knives
Title: Dull knives are dangerous!
Date: 2006-06-06T14:37:09Z
Body: A sharp knife is a sharp tool, a dull knife is just dull... There is nothing like the firm bite of a sharp knife cutting a lime for my rum & coke. :) I hate the way a dull knife squashes the peel of a tomatoe. Have you ever tried to peel the skin of a mango with a dull knife?

Goal: Visit taos, nm
Title: I spent a winter there, plus many other visits
Date: 2006-07-20T02:02:16Z
Body: I was a waiter and a ski bum for a season in 1983. It was one of the best years in the last 25 years. Waist deep powder regularly! I may have skied 6 days a week from December until season ended. Definitely worth doing!

Goal: Never stop learning
Title: Demoting this entry
Date: 2006-08-30T03:22:53Z
Body: I need space for other things that are closer on the horizon. This goal will never be fully achieved by default. It is a life process, a habit, and it is already well seated in my daily life. So I will mark it as completed, but we know it will never be done until I cease living.

Goal: Run the new york city marathon
Title: NYC Marathon
Date: 2006-10-12T03:33:40Z
Body: Well, all systems go! Plane ticket paid, sleeping quarters taken care of, running shoes broken in... Just need to get those legs back in top shape. I will not brake any records, but is should be easy to set a personal record running in such cold weather. It shure beats Panama's Try-To-Survive-90-degrees-plus-scorching-sun Marathon! But I am getting lazy... I have not been over the 40 kilometers in a week mark for a while now. But I now hot to get to the finish line of a long race. I hope this last few weeks are enough to enjoy the run!

Goal: Run the new york city marathon
Title: It is done! 3:52:34
Date: 2006-11-09T01:55:02Z
Body: I did the New York Marathon in 3:52:34, improving my PR by more than half an hour. Compared to running the marathon in Panama, New York was easy. It made a big difference running in temperatures that were more than half of what I am used to running in. I was amazed at how little effort it took to run in such cool weather. It was a phenomenal experience to run among 38,000 other runners. We were only 136 finishers in last year's Panama Marathon! And there was barely anyone to cheer us while running. In NYC there were two million cheering spectators! There were people everywhere cheering the runners, offering tidbits of food, cookies, towel paper, bananas, plus all the volunteers at the water and feed stations. Just lining the streets there were as adults as there are in my country. I definitely want to do this again, now looking for 2:30 so I can qualify for Boston!

Goal: Learn to make a great cup of coffee
Title: Very Important!
Date: 2007-02-24T12:39:55Z
Body: Hey, coffee is one of the few legal drugs you can have daily. A couple of mugs get me going every day. And an espresso at lunch keeps the day rolling along just fine. The "coffee press":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_press is probably one of the easiest ways to get a good cup of coffee every time, and it is very easy to measure how strong you want it. If you go backpacking, the cowboy way of making coffee also makes a great cup of coffee. Just boil water, add plenty of coffee, wait a little bit, and pour the coffee over the edge of the pot. The grinds will stay at the bottom of the pot.

Goal: Do an ironman.
Title: Almost there
Date: 2009-10-22T00:44:43Z
Body: I will be at Cozumel doing the Ironman on November 29 of this year. That will complete the first part of this goal, which is getting there. I hope to finish. If not, the next goal will be to finish an Ironman. I was fairly well advanced on my training, but suffered some setbacks. I hope there is enough left to complete the beast the first time around.

Goal: Run an ultra marathon!
Title: American River 50
Date: 2010-04-21T16:48:28Z
Body: I finished the American River 50 in 10:10:54 - all in one piece. Beautiful run! I would love to do it again. I am going for double the distance now.

Goal: Run an ultra marathon!
Title: Javelina Jundred 2010
Date: 2010-10-29T14:10:55Z
Body: I finished the http:://javelinajundred.com in 28:46:53, dressed as Spiderman. Great fun running in the desert. Now, it is time for Western States 100!
